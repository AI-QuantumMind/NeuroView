**Guidelines for the LLM:**  
- Generate a well-structured, coherent, and professional MRI report using full sentences, avoiding bullet points or JSON-style formatting.  
- Do not hallucinate or assume any medical findings. If information is unavailable, leave that section blank.  
- Ensure medical terminology and descriptions are clinically accurate.  
- Follow a formal tone suitable for a radiology report.  
- Maintain consistency in formatting and ensure clarity in presenting findings.
